Voice Changer Application

## Getting Started

This is an application that records, plays, and changes the properties of sound (like pitch and echo...).

It uses Flutter_FFMPEG to do the voice editing.

Just clone the repo and run:

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
