Voice Changer Application

## Getting Started

This is an application that records, plays, and changes the properties of sound (like pitch and echo...).

It uses Flutter_FFMPEG to do the voice editing.

Just clone the repo and run:

- flutter clean
- flutter pub get
- flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
- flutter run
